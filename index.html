        At the actual moment, the game logic is implemented only in Javascript and not 
        in any graphic form. That is because <strong> The Odin Project </strong> is slowly building up to 
        other, more advanced, points. Right now the focus must be directed 
        all on the Javascript logic. <strong> The game can be played from the console, which 
        you can open by using the Inspection Tab or by Ctrl + Shift + J. </strong>
