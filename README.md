# odin-rock-paper-scissors
A Rock, Paper, Scissors game - written in HTML, CSS and Javascript - done for my path in The Odin Project. The website is not responsive yet, since responsive 
techniques are learned in later courses, therefore it works as intended only on devices 
with approximate screen resolution 1920 x 1080 pixels.
